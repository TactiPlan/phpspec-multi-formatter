# juit/phpspec-multi-formatter

This project allows to have multiple formatters in one phpspec run (e.g. to have progress output on the console and 
junit xml generated at the same time).

It is heavily inspired by the phpspec-multi-formatter written by Sam Burns (https://github.com/Sam-Burns/phpspec-multi-formatter).
